# CTF Handbooks

**IMPORTANT: The CTF Handbooks project is now discontinued and the repository is archived. It's replaced and continued by the CTF Maps Guide project [here](https://github.com/a-blob/CTF-Maps-Guide), which includes the latest developments.**

This is a collection of handbooks for the [Capture the Flag game by rubenwardy](https://github.com/MT-CTF) on [Luanti (formerly Minetest)](https://github.com/minetest/minetest). The handbooks are guidelines on a variety of tasks such as making maps and testing them, written primarily with the main Capture the Flag Luanti server in mind. 

The handbooks are made with JetBrains Writerside and deployed onto the [CTF Handbooks website](https://ctf-handbooks.github.io/). The handbook markdown files are located under [`topics`](./Writerside/topics) in the [`Writerside`](./Writerside) folder.

PRs for the handbooks are welcome!

Previous versions of the handbooks can be found in the archived repositories below as normal markdown files:
* https://github.com/CTF-handbooks/map-maker-handbook
* https://github.com/CTF-handbooks/map-tester-handbook
